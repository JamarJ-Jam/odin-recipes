        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for slow cooker baby back ribs delivers tender, fall-off-the-bone meat with minimal effort. The ribs are first seasoned with a simple dry rub, a blend of spices like paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, and onion powder, which creates a flavorful crust as they cook. Placed in the slow cooker, they braise slowly in a liquid base, often a combination of barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, and a touch of Worcestershire, ensuring the meat becomes incredibly moist and succulent.</p>
        <p>After several hours of slow cooking, the ribs are removed and can be finished in the oven or on the grill for a few minutes. This final step is crucial for caramelizing the barbecue sauce that's brushed on, giving them that signature sticky, savory glaze and a slightly crisp exterior. The result is a delicious and effortless meal that captures the smoky, rich flavor of classic barbecue ribs without the need for constant monitoring, making it perfect for a relaxed family dinner or a get-together.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 rack of baby back ribs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the ribs and dry rub:</strong> In a small bowl, combine paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, and onion powder to create the dry rub. Pat the baby back ribs dry with a paper towel, then generously rub the spice mixture all over them.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the cooking liquid:</strong> In the slow cooker, mix together barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. This will be the braising liquid for the ribs.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow cook the ribs:</strong>Place the seasoned ribs into the slow cooker, ensuring they are partially submerged in the liquid. Cover and cook on low for several hours, until the meat is very tender and easily pulls away from the bone.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish with a glaze:</strong>Carefully remove the tender ribs from the slow cooker and place them on a baking sheet. Brush a generous layer of barbecue sauce over the top of the ribs.</li>
            <li><strong>Caramelize the sauce:</strong>Place the ribs under a broiler in the oven or on a hot grill for a few minutes. Watch them closely until the sauce is caramelized and bubbly, giving the ribs a delicious, sticky glaze. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
