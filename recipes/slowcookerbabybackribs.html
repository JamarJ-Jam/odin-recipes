        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for slow cooker baby back ribs delivers tender, fall-off-the-bone meat with minimal effort. The ribs are first seasoned with a simple dry rub, a blend of spices like paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, and onion powder, which creates a flavorful crust as they cook. Placed in the slow cooker, they braise slowly in a liquid base, often a combination of barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, and a touch of Worcestershire, ensuring the meat becomes incredibly moist and succulent.</p>
        <p>After several hours of slow cooking, the ribs are removed and can be finished in the oven or on the grill for a few minutes. This final step is crucial for caramelizing the barbecue sauce that's brushed on, giving them that signature sticky, savory glaze and a slightly crisp exterior. The result is a delicious and effortless meal that captures the smoky, rich flavor of classic barbecue ribs without the need for constant monitoring, making it perfect for a relaxed family dinner or a get-together.</p>
