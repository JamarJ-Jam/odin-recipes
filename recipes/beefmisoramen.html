        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a deeply savory and soul-warming noodle soup, featuring a rich, umami-packed broth that forms the perfect base. Tender, thinly sliced pieces of beef are a highlight, complementing the chewy ramen noodles that are nestled in the fragrant liquid. The dish is often topped with a vibrant array of fresh additions, adding a variety of textures and a pop of color to the bowl. It's a satisfying and hearty meal that balances comforting warmth with a complex, nuanced depth of flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
            <li>Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>
        </ol>
